# encryption-decryption-python
to be able to encrypt/decrypt a message you need to have a key which you can generate with the keygenerator.py

if you have a key you can encrypt your message

after that you can decrypt it again

however this only works if you decrypt it with the same key, that you made it with, so be careful
